> Hi everyone! I'm Siarhei, an independent Belarusian scientist and certified researcher specializing in surface and interface chemistry. In addition to my scientific work, I'm also a science communicator, journalist, and writer for [HABR](https://habr.com/ru/users/steanlab/posts)/[MEDIUM](https://medium.com/@steanlab). My scientific interests are diverse and transdisciplinary, and I'm particularly passionate about promoting citizen science. This website aims to establish an online presence in a more straightforward and "traditionally scientific" manner compared to the offerings of trendy social media.

### My research interests cover:

- **Colloid science**: adsorbents, catalysts, and their supports, nanomaterials, and hybrid composites, porous and fibrous aerosol filtering materials.
- **Industrial toxicology**: decontamination of heavy metals, plastics degradation
- **Public safety**: defense against radiation, antidotes, non-ionizing radiation, EM absorbers, personal protective equipment (PPE), Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE)
- **Green** and **Phytochemistry**: ethnobotany, bioinsecticides, biorepellents
- **FoodTech**:  novel and alternative food sources, food safety
- **Medical electronics**: wearable devices, medical sensors, Point-of-Care

**Citizen Science Public activities**
