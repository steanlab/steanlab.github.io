> Hi everyone! I’m Siarhei, an independent Belarusian scientist and certified researcher with an academic background in physical chemistry. My primary focus lies in surface and interface phenomena, particularly within colloid science and materials chemistry. Alongside my research, I actively contribute to public science communication as a writer for platforms such as [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/steanlab/posts) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@steanlab). I’m deeply committed to promoting citizen science and fostering interdisciplinary dialogue. This website serves as a professional and academically grounded alternative to conventional social media profiles.

### My research interests include:

- **Colloid ans surface science**: functional adsorbents, catalysts and their supports, nanomaterials, hybrid composites, porous and fibrous filtration materials.
- **Industrial toxicology**: remediation of heavy metals, degradation of plastics
- **Public safety and health**: radiation protection, antidotal systems, shielding from non-ionizing radiation, electromagnetic absorbers, personal and respiratory protective equipment (PPE, RPE)
- **Green** and **Phytochemistry**: ethnobotanical research, bioinsecticides, biorepellents
- **FoodTech**:  novel food sources, food safety and risk assessment
- **Medical electronics**: wearable devices, biosensors, point-of-care diagnostics

**Citizen Science Public activities**
