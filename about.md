> Hola! I’m Siarhei Besarab (@stean / @steanlab), an independent scientist, PhD Candidate (ABD), and [certified researcher]({{site.baseurl}}/images/res.jpg) specializing in Colloid Chemistry and Surface Science. I hold dual Master of Science degrees in Environmental Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Chemistry. My primary focus lies in surface and interfacial phenomena, particularly within colloid and materials chemistry. Alongside my research, I actively contribute to public science communication as a writer for platforms such as [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/steanlab/posts), [Substack](https://lab66.substack.com) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@steanlab). I’m deeply committed to promoting citizen science and fostering interdisciplinary dialogue. This website serves as a professional, academically grounded alternative to conventional social media profiles.
