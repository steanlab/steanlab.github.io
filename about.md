> Hey there everyone! My name is Siarhei, and I'm an independent scientist and certified researcher in Surface and Interface Chemistry. Additionally, I'm also a science communicator, journalist, and writer for [HABR](https://habr.com/ru/users/steanlab/posts)/[MEDIUM](https://medium.com/@steanlab). My scientific interests are broad and transdisciplinary, and also I'm passionate about promoting Citizen Science.

### My research interests include:

- **Colloid science**: adsorbents — catalysts and their supports — nanomaterials and hybrid composites — porous and fibrous aerosol filtering materials
- **Industrial toxicology**: heavy metals decontamination — plastics degradation
- **Public safety**: radiation defence — antidotes — non-ionizing radiation — EM absorbers — personal protective equipment (PPE) — Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE)
- **Green** and **Phytochemistry**: ethnobotany | bioinsecticides/biorepellents
- **FoodTech**:  novel/alternative food sources — food safety
- **Medical electronics**: wearable devices — medical sensors — Point-of-Care

**Citizen Science Public activities**
